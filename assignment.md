## GA HTML Homework

**Objectives:**

* Create a basic HTML page that is a static representation of the HappiTrails
application

**Activity:**

Create a simple webpage that contains a STATIC version of the [HappyTails
application](https://github.com/clearf/WDI_Summer_Public/blob/master/assignments/happy_tails.md).
This will not be tied to any code, but it will be a similar representation of
the output.

* Have a front page the HappiTails (index.html), with a title, and subltitle
  * *List* two clients on the main page, with links to the clients (client1.html, client2.html)

  * The link to those clients should connect to a separate page with their name, age, gender, 
    and the number of pets they have. 
  * Each client should have one pet
    * Include a link to the client's respective pets (pet1.html, pet2.html) 
    * Create a link to the pet see a page with their names, breed, age, gender and 
      their favorite toys, and an image of the pets. 
  * The shelter page should also have links to the pets' pages (to the same
  pages above)
  * We've made blank files with a suggested structure.
