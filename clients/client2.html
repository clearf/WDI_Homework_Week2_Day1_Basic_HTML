<h4>This is Laura's story</h4>
<p>
Laura is a 20 year old college student with a small budget but a big heart.  She wanted to open up her home to a small cat while she finished up her senior year.  The team at Happytails matched her with <a href="../pets/pet2.html">Robin</a>, a small Sengalese kitten who needed a temporary home while her parents were out of the country.  The two have been inseparable ever since.

"If I'm still in the city next year, I would absolutely take on another pet from Happytails.  The staff is super supportive and I'm excited about providing the love and attention to an animal in need when I can."
