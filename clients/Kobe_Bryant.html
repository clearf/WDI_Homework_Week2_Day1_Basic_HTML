<p> Kobe Bryant has contributed almost as much to the game of basketball as he has to animals and the broader movement for animals' rights awareness. In his eighteen seasons as a Laker, Kobe has organized numerous events on behalf of the organization "Pets for Vets", which pairs shelter animals in the hands of recovering war veterans. Together we can make a difference.   </p>
