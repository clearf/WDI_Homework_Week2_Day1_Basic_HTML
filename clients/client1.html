<h4>This is Adam's story</h4>
<p>
Adam is a 32 year old Boston native.  When he first moved to New York, he was outraged that the apartment he found would not allow dogs.  Devastated with nowhere to turn, Adam visited Happitails in search of options.  After meeting with our director, Kenya, Adam was sure that his friend, <a href="../pets/pet1.html">Rex</a>, would be left in capable hands.

"The greatest thing about Happytails was that they sent me monthly postcards of Rex and his latest activities.  When he was adopted by a new family, I was informed of this and since then I've reached out the the family several times.  I couldn't have dreamt of a better outcome."
